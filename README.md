# BetterDocking
A Mod for Avorion that enforces a system wide don't drink and drive - policy for tradeship pilots

# What it does:

- prevents Traders from crashing into stations (and other things) at all costs. Try it and troll them. I dare you! :) (But please share findings with me in the unlikely case that you can actually make them fly into things again)
- prevents traders from wreaking havoc over your station in case you're currently building it and "accidentally" delete their desired docking port in the process.
- prevents traders from push stations across the whole system. Won't happen again.

# What it does not:
- Enforce aforementioned policy. They still do what they want... It's just that their autopilot got a decent upgrade now :P


P.S.:
comes bundled with LogLevels from the great Dirtyredz <3
