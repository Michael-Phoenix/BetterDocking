# BetterDocking
A Mod for Avorion that enforces a system wide don't drink and fly - policy for tradeship pilots
# current release: 
https://github.com/kalvindukes/BetterDocking/releases/latest


# What it does:
- prevents Traders from crashing into stations (and other things) at all costs. (Please share findings with me in case that you can actually make them fly into things again)
- prevents traders from wreaking havoc over your station in case you're currently building it and "accidentally" delete their desired docking port in the process.
- prevents traders from pushing stations across the whole system. Won't happen again.
- Traders now use the docking port closest to their entry point to the system, distributing load over all docking ports
- Traders who just take too long, now jump out of the sector again in order to prevent https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_syndrome

# What it does not:
- Enforce aforementioned policy. They still do what they want... It's just that their autopilot got a decent upgrade now :P

# Verification:
Over a course of several days of testing, there was some data gathered for camparison. Latest results show a significant reduction of docking accidents: V1.0.4 is down to one accident per ~600 Docking maneuvers (your mileage may still vary depending on station and ship hulls)
